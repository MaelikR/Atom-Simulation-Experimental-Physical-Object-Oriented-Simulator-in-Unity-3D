# 🧬 Atom Simulation – Experimental Physical Object-Oriented Simulator in Unity 3D

Welcome to the **Atom Simulation** project – a unique and experimental Unity-based physical simulator designed to explore scientific calculations (like the number of atoms in a liquid) within a 3D interactive and object-oriented environment.

This project is currently **under active development** and is the first step toward building a strange, immersive, and possibly groundbreaking simulation system.

---

## 🚀 What is this project?

This is not your average simulator.

It begins with a simple idea:  
> *"How many atoms are there in a puddle of water 30 cm wide?"*

Instead of just solving that question with numbers, the goal is to **turn it into a real-time, interactive 3D experience**, where physics, data, molecules, and particles **live** and evolve inside a visual Unity world.

## 🧩 Key Features (WIP)

- 🌊 **3D Simulation of Water Volume** – Starting with a virtual puddle of 30cm diameter and 0.5cm depth.
- ⚛️ **Precise Atom Calculation** – Using molar mass, density, Avogadro’s number, and custom molecules.
- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Molecule System** – Built with `Molecule` and `LiquidBody` classes to easily simulate different substances.
- 📊 **Real-Time Value Display** – See the number of atoms calculated and rendered as scientific notation in-game.
- 🧪 **Modular Design** – Built to expand into more complex simulations like ethanol, mercury, or alien matter.
- 👁️ **Visual Layer** – Includes UI, particles, and camera orbit system for interactive exploration.
- 🧙‍♂️ **Experimental Physics** – The project will later introduce odd or surreal laws of physics depending on data thresholds.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Unity 6000.0.50f1 (LTS)**
- **HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline)**
- **Unity UI Toolkit + TextMeshPro**
- **C# (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Custom Physics Models**
- **Photon Fusion 2+** (for experimental multiplayer/networked simulations)

---

## 📦 Required Unity Packages

Make sure the following Unity packages are installed:

- ✅ `High Definition RP` (`com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition`)
- ✅ `UI Toolkit` and `TextMeshPro`
- ✅ `Photon Fusion 2` (via Fusion SDK package or Asset Store)
- ✅ `Input System` (if using newer input bindings)
- 🔁 Optional: `Cinemachine` for camera control

## 🔮 Vision & Next Steps

This project is the **foundation for a weird and beautiful simulator** where physical realism blends with imaginative rules:

- Simulate different liquids and their atom structures.
- Introduce gravity/time distortions based on atom counts.
- Create a user-driven sandbox with sliders, toggleable laws, and molecule mutations.
- Possibly allow networking and players interacting with their own atom fields.
