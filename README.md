# 🧬 Atom Simulation – Experimental Physical Object-Oriented Simulator in Unity 3D

Welcome to the **Atom Simulation** project – a unique and experimental Unity-based physical simulator designed to explore scientific calculations (like the number of atoms in a liquid) within a 3D interactive and object-oriented environment.

This project is currently **under active development** and is the first step toward building a strange, immersive, and possibly groundbreaking simulation system.

## 🚀 What is this project?

This is not your average simulator.

It begins with a simple idea:  
> *"How many atoms are there in a puddle of water 30 cm wide?"*

Instead of just solving that question with numbers, the goal is to **turn it into a real-time, interactive 3D experience**, where physics, data, molecules, and particles **live** and evolve inside a visual Unity world.

## 🧩 Key Features (Evolving)

### ⚛️ Atom & Molecule Simulation
- Modular object-oriented atoms and molecules (`Atom`, `Molecule`, `LiquidBody`, etc.)
- Real-time scientific calculation using molar mass, density, volume, and Avogadro's number
- Visual representation of atoms with floating behavior, rotation, and glow

### 🌊 Physical Volume Simulator
- Adjustable virtual puddle (30 cm diameter, 0.5 cm depth)
- Mass and volume-based molecule distribution
- Dynamic pressure, temperature, and environment interactions

### 🌐 Evolutionary Mechanics (NEW)
- Atoms mutate into living **organisms** after energy depletion
- Organisms evolve into **fish** and possibly other life forms
- Fish behavior includes group movement, fear of player, curiosity for atoms, and attraction to light
- Fish flee predators (e.g. **sharks**), which autonomously hunt nearby prey

### 💡 Environmental Stimuli
- Light attraction and molecular curiosity
- Depth-based temperature curve and comfort zones
- Fish react to cold or heat and adjust their swimming patterns accordingly

### 🎮 Interactivity & Visuals
- FPS controller to swim and explore the world
- Click-based energy interaction with atoms
- Dynamic fog, water shaders, particles, sound (WIP)

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Unity 2022+**
- **C# (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **TextMeshPro (UI)**
- **Custom Physics Models**
- (Optional Future) **Photon Fusion** for multiplayer simulation sharing

---

## 🔮 Vision & Next Steps

This project is the **foundation for a weird and beautiful simulator** where physical realism blends with imaginative rules:

- Add fish transformation into humanoids
- Introduce plant simulation and molecule harvesting
- Cinematic sequences (from atom birth to organism migration)
- Network support with synchronized biomes
- Dynamic species behavior per biome, including reproduction & death
- Player influence: attract, mutate, or destroy molecules
